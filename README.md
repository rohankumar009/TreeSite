# CompanyWebsite

## Project Goal
In this deeply personal project, I am embarking on a web development journey with a clear goal in mind. I want to create a captivating "company website" that not only showcases my creativity but also serves as a remarkable learning experience. My objective is to master the art of web development while gaining a comprehensive understanding of HTTP and web protocols.

Through this project, I aspire to:
1. Establish a well-structured workflow and select an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that perfectly aligns with my working style.
2. Dive into the intricate world of HTML5, perfecting my skills in crafting web content that adheres to industry standards.
3. Explore the fundamental concepts of back-end coding by setting up a Python server and skillfully routing URLs to their designated HTML files.
4. Challenge myself by delving into the basics of CSS, pushing the boundaries of what I've learned so far and demonstrating my capacity for self-learning in the field of web development.

This project is not merely about creating a website; it's a journey of personal growth, a chance to learn, and an opportunity to evolve as a web developer.
