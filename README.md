## Project Goal
In this deeply personal project, I am embarking on a web development journey with a clear goal in mind. I want to create a captivating "company website" that not only showcases my creativity but also serves as a remarkable learning experience. My objective is to master the art of web development while gaining a comprehensive understanding of HTTP and web protocols.

Through this project, I aspire to:
1. Establish a well-structured workflow and select an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that perfectly aligns with my working style.
2. Dive into the intricate world of HTML5, perfecting my skills in crafting web content that adheres to industry standards.
3. Explore the fundamental concepts of back-end coding by setting up a Python server and skillfully routing URLs to their designated HTML files.
4. Challenge myself by delving into the basics of CSS, pushing the boundaries of what I've learned so far and demonstrating my capacity for self-learning in the field of web development.

This project is not merely about creating a website; it's a journey of personal growth, a chance to learn, and an opportunity to evolve as a web developer.

## Learning Goals
As I embark on this project, I have a clear set of learning objectives in mind:
- **Workflow Mastery**: My first goal is to establish an efficient workflow that streamlines the web development process, with a focus on choosing the right Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and setting up the project environment as the foundation of my success.
- **HTML Proficiency**: I aim to utilize HTML5, ensuring that the web pages I create are not only functional but also adhere to the highest standards of validation and correctness.
- **Linked Constructs Exploration**: I'll delve into the intricacies of web development by exploring linked constructs such as hyperlinks, images, and embedded content from external sources.
- **Back-End Basics**: Additionally, I'll seize the opportunity to grasp the basics of back-end development by setting up a Python server and mastering URL routing.
- **CSS Challenge**: To enhance the visual appeal of my website, I'll tackle a CSS challenge that goes beyond the basics, relying on technical references and guides for guidance.
- **Preparation for the Future**: Lastly, I'll lay the groundwork for future assignments and more complex web development tasks, ensuring my journey is a continuous path of growth and learning.
